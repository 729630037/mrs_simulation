These files intended to help creating a reference map of the environment.

	1. Start the simulation - 'morse run environmentMapping.py'
	2. Start the corresponding launch file - 'roslaunch environmentMapping.py'
	3. Control the robot with the keyboard (arrow keys) and inspect the the visualization in rviz
	4. When the map looks fine, save it with the command 'rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap' (before shutting down the launch file!)


Resolution or map size for other environments can be changed in the launch file.
